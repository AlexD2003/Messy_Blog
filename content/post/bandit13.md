# Level goal
The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

### Login
*ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220*\
*FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn*

#### A bit of backstory
An SSH key is a secure access credential used in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SSH key pairs use public key infrastructure (PKI) technology, the gold standard for digital identity authentication and encryption, to provide a secure and scalable method of authentication.

### Solution
By using **ls**, you can see that there`s a file named **sshkey.private**.
Since it is stated that only bandit14 has access to the flag stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** our approach should be making our request as **bandit14**. When **sshing** you can use a key as your login method instead of the text password we were used to until now by specifing the -i flag.

bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
{{< /highlight >}}
Since bandit13, the endpoint we are also on, is hosted on bandit.labs.overthewire.org, we can simply specify localhost as the host and use **ssh** in pair with the key to connect and then just **cat** the respective file.
