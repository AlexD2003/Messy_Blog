### Doc
[What is inspect element?](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect#:~:text=What%20does%20%E2%80%9Cinspect%20element%E2%80%9D%20mean,live%20inside%20the%20browser%20window.)\
Inspect element is a feature of modern web browsers that enables anyone to view and edit a websiteâ€™s source code, including its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. When the source code is modified with the inspect tool, the changes are shown live inside the browser window.

### Solution
As per the previous level, this is gonna be an incredibly simple sollution. You are prompted with the text that just like before, the password is hidden in the webpage. The difference now is that you cannot right click on the page in order to inspect it. You can still use **Ctrl+Shift+i** or whatever bind you would have on your browser to enter inspect mode and that`s about it.
