# Level goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

### Login
*ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220*\
*x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO*

### Doc
{{< highlight html >}}
ssh (1)              - OpenSSH remote login client
{{< /highlight >}}

### Solution
This is a very easy sollution just like the one from the previous level. Since you get logged out right after logging in you can\`t really do much since you can\`t run any commands right? Well you could just pass the output of **echo "cat readme"** into the ssh login and it will cat the required file **readme** right at the start, therefore you don`t need to actually do anything in the terminal yourself.

Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
