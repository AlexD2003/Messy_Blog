### Doc

tr (1)               - translate or delete characters

### Solution
There are a lot of websites that offer ROT13 encryption/decryption, but sadly there is no build-in ROT13 command in Linux. However, I wanted a solution for the terminal, so I used the tr command for substitution.

The substitution for ROT13 is A->N,â€¦,Z->M. With tr it would be:

bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt

bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
