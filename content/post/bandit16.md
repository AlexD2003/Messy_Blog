# Level goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

### Doc
{{< highlight html >}}
nmap (1)             - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner
SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION:
  -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
  --version-intensity <level>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes)
  --version-light: Limit to most likely probes (intensity 2)
  --version-all: Try every single probe (intensity 9)
  --version-trace: Show detailed version scan activity (for debugging)

### What is nmap (u`ll use it again)
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts.

### Solution
We can use **nmap** in order to scan certain aspects of a network w.r.t. our needs. Sice the level goal states that the password is nested on localhost on a port in range **31000-32000** we should scan the range of ports with a flag to sort them based on the service running on each port. (-sV, see doc)
#### Scan phase (may take a while)
{{< highlight html >}}
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV localhost -p31000-32000
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-18 14:05 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00014s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)

31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo

#### Connect
As we could see previously, there are 5 open ports in the range out of which, only 2 use SSL encryption. Now we use **openssl** just like in the previous level for the ports **31518,31790**.\
**Note.** If at the time of you doing this your key starts with k like mine, try using **-quiet** in order to not KEYUPDATE.

bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet

#### Connect to bandit 17
You can see that the ouput after inserting the correct key was a private key. Copy that key into somefile.private and connect to bandit17 as you normally would but also add the flag **-i** in combination with the file where you copied the private key.
