&lt;h4 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technical project is designed to evaluate your technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities
in both Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. The project will help us assess how well you
understand the concepts and tools you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with during the internship. The project should take
no more than 2 to 3 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are tasked with designing a simple data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric and performing data science
tasks using Python. Most likely, you don&amp;rsquo;t have experience with Microsoft Fabric. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in how
your mind works when you have to face a challenge like this. Microsoft Fabric is a comprehensive data
analytics platform that integrates data engineering, data science, data warehousing, and business
intelligence in one environment. By using Microsoft Fabric, we expect our interns to gain hands-on
experience with a tool that Microsoft expects to be widely adopted in the industry. This exposure not only
makes you more competitive in the job market but also prepares you for real-world scenarios where you
are likely to encounter similar integrated platforms.&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft Fabric is a paid tool, so in order to solve these exercises, you have to simply read the
documentation to have an introduction to the tool, watch a few tutorials if needed and answer the
questions based on your findings and your prior knowledge from University courses. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to
access Fabric for this basic assignment. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to implement the solution, only to design it based
on the documentation that you read. You can use text descriptions or any type of visual representation to
answer the questions (e.g. Dataflow diagrams) for Section 1. For Section 2 you can implement the solution
for free using Google Colab or any other local python environment.&lt;br&gt;
The project is divided into two main sections: Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a new data engineer at a retail company. The company has a dataset containing information on
customer transactions. Your task is to design and implement a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and
stores this data using Microsoft Fabric.&lt;br&gt;
The dataset is available here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadrehman07/retail-transaction-dataset?resource=download&#34;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadrehman07/retail-transaction-dataset?resource=download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-1-premise&#34;&gt;Task 1 premise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: First, you have to bring this data into Fabric. How do you envision this? What will be the expected
steps? How exactly will it be stored? Is the data in a suitable format and size to ingest in Fabric? What can
you do related to storage in order to improve the performance of the future data queries if the size of the
dataset is expected to grow in time (hint: e.g. partition the data)?
(Answer with text descriptions or diagrams)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-1-solution&#34;&gt;Task 1 solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I will begin by looking at the data set given in the premise in order to get a feeling for what I am working with.&lt;br&gt;
The data set is presented in &lt;strong&gt;csv format and has a size of around 13MB (important for later)&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems to be a &lt;strong&gt;retail transaction data set&lt;/strong&gt;, basically oferring you a peek at common consumer purchase patterns with the present collumns being : &lt;strong&gt;CustomerId, ProductId, Quantity, Price, TransactionDate, PaymentMethod, StoreLocation, ProductCategory, AppliedDiscount and TotalAmount&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Since the data set is given in csv format which is compatible with the import feature of &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Fabric&lt;/strong&gt; and the size is not significant, the import should be pretty straight forward. We should plan for further expansion tho.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Okay, how how do I import it?&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly, in what? A quick look around google later, the most obvious choice was between a &lt;strong&gt;Data Lake or a Data Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt;. I would go with a &lt;strong&gt;Data Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt; since it is meant for already structured data (exactly like my data set) while a &lt;strong&gt;Data Lake&lt;/strong&gt; is more inclined towards raw data meant for analysis and further implications in various projects. &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-data-lake#:~:text=risks%20more%20efficiently.-,What&#39;s%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20data%20lake%20and%20a%20data,as%20specific%20BI%20use%20cases.&#34;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to import this data into Microsoft Fabric we could setup a pipeline. &lt;strong&gt;Pipeline setup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure an automated data pipeline within Microsoft Fabric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source : We should point the pipeline towards the source location of the &lt;strong&gt;csv file&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformation : We should always think about transforming data when we are doing an import in order to further suit our needs, for example remove unnecessary collumns or filter just what we need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destination : Finally, we set the pipeline to store the ingested data into our Data Warehouse, as explained earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sourcehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvloescjpru8w&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoESCJpru8w&#34;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do related to storage in order to improve the performance of the future data queries if the size of the dataset is expected to grow in time (hint: e.g. partition the data)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the ingested data is stored in a &lt;strong&gt;Data Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt;, it is prone to efficient querying. In order to further improve the performance, from my work experience, I would suggest partitioning the data by &lt;strong&gt;TransactionDate&lt;/strong&gt; and possibly by &lt;strong&gt;ProductId&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, converting the data into Parquet format will improve storage efficiency. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrometa.com/articles/what-is-data-partitioning&#34;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;data-flow-diagram-&#34;&gt;Data flow diagram :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/img/dataingdiagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;gif&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-2-premise&#34;&gt;Task 2 premise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: Like most of the datasets you&amp;rsquo;ll find in your practice, this dataset has some data issues that
should be corrected. You need to find a way within Microsoft Fabric to perform the following
transformations:&lt;br&gt;
Separate TransactionDate column in 2 distinct columns for Date and Time.&lt;br&gt;
Aggregate the TotalAmount spent by each customer per month.&lt;br&gt;
Replace the &amp;ldquo;Home Decor&amp;rdquo; values from the ProductCategory column with &amp;ldquo;Home Products&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
Create a new column HighValueCustomer that is a boolean column that assigns True or False based on
your own rule. Think about a rule with a logic that makes sense in the context.&lt;br&gt;
Load the transformed data into a new table in your Data Lake.&lt;br&gt;
How do you envision solving this based on your research on Microsoft Fabric? No implementation is
needed.&lt;br&gt;
(Answer with text descriptions, images or diagrams).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;task-2-solution&#34;&gt;Task 2 solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate TransactionDate into 2 columns.&lt;/strong&gt; As I explained previously, before sending the ingested data to the Data Warehouse we should parse it through a Data Transformation step. In order to achieve what is asked, there are Microsoft data pipeline capabilities that could get the expected result. Data pipelines in Fabric are designed to allow for complex data manipulations and transformations as part of the data flow. Withing the pipeline, we could add a transformation step for the received data. Fabric allows for transformations through both low-code/no-code interfaces and SQL-based transformations and for this task, I think that a simple SQL snippet should suffice. &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/transform-data&#34;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sql-snippet-&#34;&gt;SQL snippet :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    ProductID,
    Quantity,
    Price,
    CAST(TransactionDate AS DATE) AS Date,
    CAST(TransactionDate AS TIME) AS Time,
    etc.
FROM 
    RetailTransactions
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation :&lt;/strong&gt; Casting the datetime variable as DATE and TIME respectively, we will only get the DATE and TIME part of the initial value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregate the TotalAmount spent by each customer per month.&lt;/strong&gt; The first step would be separating the &lt;strong&gt;Year&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Month&lt;/strong&gt; values from &lt;strong&gt;TransactionDate&lt;/strong&gt; in order to diferentiate between the entries. We should use a transformation step in the pipepline to create new entries just like we did last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sql-snippet--1&#34;&gt;SQL snippet :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 
    CustomerId,
    YEAR(TransactionDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(TransactionDate) AS Month,
    TotalAmount
FROM 
    RetailTransactions
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have extracted the relevant information, we could agregate the TotalAmount for each customer on a monthly basis.&lt;br&gt;
Step 1 : Add an aggregation component to the pipeline.&lt;br&gt;
Step 2 : Configure the aggregation component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sql-snippet--2&#34;&gt;SQL snippet :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT 
    CustomerId,
    YEAR(TransactionDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(TransactionDate) AS Month,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM 
    RetailTransactions
GROUP BY 
    CustomerId, 
    YEAR(TransactionDate),
    MONTH(TransactionDate);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basically just sums the TotalAmount based on each month.&lt;br&gt;
As always, after getting the result we should do some data validation in order to make sure that we have consistancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace the &amp;ldquo;Home Decor&amp;rdquo; values from the ProductCategory column with &amp;ldquo;Home Products&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; This will be pretty straight forward since we could just use a case when statement. We should insert a transformation component in the pipeline with the directive of changing the values in ProductCategory just when the case is met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sql-snippet--3&#34;&gt;SQL snippet :&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CASE 
    WHEN ProductCategory = &amp;#39;Home Decor&amp;#39; THEN &amp;#39;Home Products&amp;#39;
    ELSE ProductCategory
END AS ProductCategory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
