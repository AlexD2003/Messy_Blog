[{"categories":["Overthewire","Natas"],"contents":"Introduction This is the introductory level for the \u0026ldquo;Natas\u0026rdquo; wargame hosted by Overthewire\nWhat is Natas? Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.\nEach level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.\nEach level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5. Source\nThere will be no level goals for this wargame, just get in and mess around.\nLogin Username: natas0/ Password: natas0/ URL: http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org\nDoc What is inspect element?\nInspect element is a feature of modern web browsers that enables anyone to view and edit a website’s source code, including its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. When the source code is modified with the inspect tool, the changes are shown live inside the browser window.\nSolution Let`s connect to the provided URL with the given credentials. Immediatly we are hit with a prompt saying that the password for the next level is located in this webpage.\nThe first thing you want to do when you don`t know what to do in order to progress further is to inspect the webpage you suspect could have a clue and sniff around the guts of the page to see what you can find. In this case, because this is the first level, the password is just there and that`s it! Use it for natas1.\nCongrats!\n","date":"2024-08-19T22:46:42+03:00","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/natas1/","section":"post","tags":["CTF","Completed"],"title":"Natas-Level 0"},{"categories":["Overthewire","Bandit"],"contents":"Level goal After all this git stuff, it’s time for another escape.

After that, we can see that our associated user is bandit33 wich means we can cat the password for the next level.

However, we are constantly working on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon. Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Source\nSolution We can use nmap in order to scan certain aspects of a network w.r.t. our needs. Sice the level goal states that the password is nested on localhost on a port in range 31000-32000 we should scan the range of ports with a flag to sort them based on the service running on each port.

Solution The solution for this level is pretty long and tedious. It`s all about understanding how files are compressed, how to see what a random file in memory actually is and how to get the data behind it.\nStep 1. Using mktemp -d you can create a temporary directory in the /tmp path in order to process certain files or create stuff where you otherwise wouldn`t have permissions to do so. We will move the initial data.txt to our new directory and use xxd since we know from the start it is a hexdump. bandit12@bandit:~$ ls data.txt bandit12@bandit:~$ mktemp -d /tmp/tmp.esFHBLf5iQ bandit12@bandit:~$ cp data.txt /tmp/tmp.esFHBLf5iQ/data.txt bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.esFHBLf5iQ bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.esFHBLf5iQ$ cat data.txt | xxd -r \u0026gt; data\nStep 2.
